We began life with just two partners and a secretary wanting to actively attract claimants motivated by the desire for personal vindication as well as financial compensation

<p>We're now a 200 strong team with four offices - Newcastle, Leeds, Ipswich and Birmingham - each staffed by highly trained people who never falter from our fundamental principle...</p>

<b>TRUE Solicitors LLP - we stand for genuine compensation, never unjust CONpensation.</b>

<p>Our teams of professional, approachable and highly dependable experts have supported millions of clients who understand the true motivation behind compensation claims - and it’s never been to get undeserved financial reward. Not with us.</p>

<p>When injured parties come to us, they often have doubts about the certainty of claiming. TRUE Solicitors LLP gives honest advice and sets achievable goals<gt>;</gt> we never mislead, never inflate the figures and never knowingly pursue a claim that isn't justified - </p>

<br/>

this is how we maintain our impressive success rate.
David Hamilton. Founding Partner
